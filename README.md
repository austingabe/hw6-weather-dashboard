# hw6-weather-dashboard

A weather application that allows the user to search for a city and its current and future weather conditions. When a search is made, the city name, an icon representing current conditions in that city, and the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for that city appear. The UV index will appear green, yellow, or red to indicate good, moderate, and bad conditions, respectively.

In addition to the current weather conditions, a search will also bring up a five-day forecast of that city with dates, icons representing forecasted conditions, future high temperatures, and future humidity levels as well.

A search will append to a list below the search bar each city that has been searched for. Search history is set in local storage, and the latest search query will appear upon page reload. Upon clicking a city in the list, current and future conditions for that city will reappear.

The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was utilized in generating the date displayed at the top of the page next to the current city as well as each date in the five-day forecast.

Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com) was used as the CSS framework for this application.
